The goal of the Maynooth University Department of Computer Science is the development of the field of Computer Science by:
1. 	the provision of world class degree programmes at both undergraduate and graduate level, 
1. 	pushing the boundaries of Computer Science knowledge through both basic and applied research, and, 
1. 	promotion of the discipline through engaging with the wider society via outreach activities, liaising with national and international bodies (e.g. the ICS, ACM, IEEE), etc. 

The department's research postgraduate community has a central role to play in each of these activities primarily through their research, but also through involvement in wide spectrum of the department's activities. The strategic plans of both the department and the university prioritise the continuing development of the research postgraduate environment to provide an engine of learning at the core of our work.

The purpose of this handbook is to specify an environment where learning is maximised: both individually, through your own research, and as a group through participation in postgraduate workshop and related activities. Research postgraduates are unique in the student community in that their work has to regularly attain the highest international standards to merit publication, and it is vital that the department fosters an environment that facilitates this.

This handbook describes department-specific arrangements, and should be read in conjunction with the relevant Maynooth University policies and regulations, available from the [Graduate Studies Office webpage](https://www.maynoothuniversity.ie/graduate-studies) and the [Academic Policies and Procedure Webpage](https://www.maynoothuniversity.ie/university-policies/academic-policies-procedures).
