## CS Structured Ph.D./M.Sc. Programme

The current regulations state that PhD students must successfully complete 30 ECTS, whilst M.Sc. students are required to complete 10 ECTS. In each case, 50% of those ECTS must be *subject specific* modules, whilst the other 50% must be *transferable skills* modules. 

The CS PhD structured programme has two  mandatory modules covering this 30 ECTS requirement:

- [CS865 Computer Science PhD Year 1](https://apps.maynoothuniversity.ie/courses/?TARGET=MODULE&MODE=VIEW&MODULE_CODE=CS865), 15 ECTS
- [CS875 Computer Science PhD Year 2](https://apps.maynoothuniversity.ie/courses/?TARGET=MODULE&MODE=VIEW&MODULE_CODE=CS875), 15 ECTS 

A complete list of additional (optional) modules available as part of the Structured PhD is provided  on the [Maynooth University Courses Portal](https://apps.maynoothuniversity.ie/courses/?TARGET=QS&MODE=VIEW&QUALIFICATION_CODE=PHDS&TARGET_SOURCE=CS#ANCHOR_SEARCH). 


#### Timeline Overview  for CS Structured PhD/MSc Programme (Full-time)

| Year | CS Mandatory Modules | Notable Deliverables (PhD) | Notable Deliverables (MSc) |
|------|----------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| 1    | CS865                |                            |                            |
| 2    | CS875                | Interim thesis with defence (DRSPC panel) | MSc thesis                 |
| 3    |                      |                            |                            |
| 4    |                      | PhD thesis with defence    |                            |  

**Notes:**

- Research students' work is reviewed each year for progression to the next year of the CS PhD/MSc programme. 
- Part-time research students are expected to complete the programme in 6 years (PhD) and 3 years (MSc).
- Full-time students usually work 9am-5pm and some work outside these hours. Holidays are equivalent to when in employment (~4 weeks per year). Full-time students are expected to work five days a week. Part-time students typically have 2/3 of the commitment of full-time students (source: see [MyPhD FAQ](https://www.myphd.ie/for-phd-students/faq)).
